## HEADERS

## TECH STACK

## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

Always create an `AGENTS.md` file with project details to aid autonomous agents in understanding the project.

## CODING STANDARDS

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

When creating new projects, initialize git, publish the repository publicly to GitHub under the user `kjanat`. The repository name should be `pomodoro-timer`. Create a new branch for development and add a GitHub Pages workflow action. Use `pnpm` as the package manager.

## DEBUGGING

When dealing with Dependabot alerts related to vulnerable dependencies, especially transitive ones, investigate the root dependency causing the issue and attempt to update it or find a suitable alternative that resolves the vulnerability.
